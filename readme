UPDATE 2015-03-27: I've found the original plugin (still maintained by Elan) on GitHub at https://github.com/glensc/nagios-plugin-check_domain. It has improved much more than this one so I've contributed the minor additions from this repo upstream and am going to switch to that version.

If you want to use this version because you find it simpler, that is fine. I won't be deleting it. I will test and accept pull requests, but won't be doing much more.

If you want to add a TLD to either this or nagios-plugin-check_domain, the best thing to do is create an issue on the original repo (linked above).

This is a Nagios plugin to check the expiration date of a domain name.
It uses the "whois" command, which usually comes as a "whois" package.
Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install whois
RHEL/CentOS: yum install jwhois
